        <p>
          Brew & Beans began as a small family café in the 1950s, founded on the belief that
          coffee should be both an art and a welcome. Our founders opened the doors with a
          single espresso machine, a handful of treasured recipes, and a promise to treat
          every guest like family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, that same spirit shapes everything we do. Our staff is a close‑knit team,
          many of whom have grown up in the café, carrying forward the warmth and care that
          defined the early days. We still roast in small batches, bake our pastries each
          morning, and craft every cup with attention to detail and heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you’re stopping in for a quiet moment or sharing time with friends, we
          hope Brew & Beans feels like a second home—rooted in tradition, and brewed for the
          present.
